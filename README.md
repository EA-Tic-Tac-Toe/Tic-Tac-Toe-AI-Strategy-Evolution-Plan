# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Strategy Evolution Plan


## Overview

| Aspect     | Description                                                                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Objective   | Create an AI agent that learns to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using evolutionary strategies.          |
| Method      | Encode a strategy (or small neural net) as a genome, evolve via GA to maximize performance.          |
| Outcome     | Demonstrate improvement of agent fitness over generations and compare GA-based vs. fixed-rule play.  |
